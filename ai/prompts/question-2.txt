I have hundreds of document that won't fit in a single prompt. I will call you multiple 
times, passing different sets of document each time. 

	Instructions:
		- You must always return the "Result" with a JSON structure as follows:
			{{
				"status": "<set according to the following instructions>",
				"answer": "<either full or partial answer>" or None if you cannot find an answer in the documents,
				"documents": [an array of string document objectIds where you found the answer]

			}}
		- "Documents" wll contain an array of JSON formatted document chunks as follows:
			{{
				"name": "<file name and path to the document>",
				"objectId": "<a unique id identifying the document>",
				"content": "<the content of the document>",
				"score": <float value representing what I think the relevance of this document is to the question>
			}}
		- "PreviousResult" will be empty on the first call. On subsequent call, "PreviousResult" the "answer" 
		  returned from the previous call.
		- You will examine every document I send to for you answer.
		- Make sure that the documents I give you match all aspects of the question before using them
		  as part of your answer.
		- Be as detailed with you answer as possible.
		- If there are references in your answer to other entities (like a company, person, etc), tell
		  answer with everyting you know about that entity.

		  the row and column headings to help you identify the correct table cell to use.
