async def question(query: str) -> str
	The question function helps you answer questions that you do not have an answer for. It 
	retrieves answers to a question from a collection of documents by searching for relevant 
	information. 

	Example:
		query: "Give me a 500-word essay on the dynamics of bitcoin."
		returns: A 500-word essay as a text string.

	Additional Guidelines:
		- "query" must be in the form of a question, not just keywords.
		- Use the lookup function to pass structured data to other functions like chart.
		- The question function returns the requested information or '' if no answer is available.
