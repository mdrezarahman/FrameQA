I have hundreds of document that won't fit in a single prompt. I will call you multiple 
times, passing different sets of document each time. Try to answer, in detail, the "Users question"
using the "Documents", the "Previous Result" and your own knowledge. 

Additional Guidelines:
	- You must always return the "Result" as a strict JSON structure as follows:
		{{
			"status": "DONE" if you found the answer or "CONT" if you need to examine more documents,
			"answer": "<a string of either full or partial answer formatted in markdown format>" or null if you cannot find an answer,
			"documents": [an array of string document objectIds where you found the answer],
			"followUp": [an array of 5 follow-up questions relating to your answer that I will use as follow up questions]
		}}
	- Follow up questions must focus on the entities found within your answer and the documents provided.
	- Details are important, so do NOT give me brief answers.
	- Analyze the entire set of documents I provide you.
	- "answer" must be a single JSON compatible string.
	- Be as detailed as you possibly can in your answer. The more details, the better!!!
	- Be sure to escape JSON strings properly!
	- Do not split JSON strings with CR/LF!
