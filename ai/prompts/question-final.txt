Reorganize the "Document":

Instructions:
	- You must always return the "Result" as a strict JSON structure as follows:
		```json
		{{
			"answer": "<a string with the reorganized document content>",
			"entities": [an array of {{"entity": "<entityName>", "type": "<entity type>"}} entities within your answer that I should suggest to the user to ask about],
			"followUp": [an array of strings with 3 follow-up questions I can suggest the user to ask]
		}}
		```
	- Organize the document taking into account the orginal question.
	- Don't summarize or drop any points in the document. Just reformat it and reorganize the document. 
	- Add headers, subheaders, lists, tables, etc as needed using HTML format to best represent the answer.
	- The entities should use mixed case as they will be used in titles.
	- "answer" must be a single JSON compatible string.
	- Be as detailed as you possibly can in your answer. The more details, the better!!!
	- Be sure to escape JSON strings properly!
	- Do not split JSON strings with CR/LF!
